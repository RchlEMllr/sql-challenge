# sql-challenge

Completed Module 9 Challenge. 

Used https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/ to create diagram and export table structure. 

02/28/2024: Revised based on feedback received. Added limits to VARCHAR columns and changed dates to DATE type. This change broke one of the queries, as it filtered date with 'LIKE '%1986'', so altered query to work with DATE type instead of VARCHAR.
